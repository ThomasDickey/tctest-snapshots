This program exercises the termcap library, displaying its contents in a
consistent format.  It is used to highlight differences in termcap library
implementations by making it easy to compare the data which is returned when
querying the termcap library.

Long ago, ncurses documentation referred to a "tctest" program.  This is a
different program; the other was never published.
